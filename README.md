# RObert Package Manager (ROPM)

Written by Ayaan Eusufzai

ROPM is a package manager/wrapper that blends in dnf and flatpaks into one utility through countainerised and normal, system-wide packages (CS system)
furthermore, it is designed to be lightweight and is written in bash. 

The "Robert" part of the name comes from my childhood teddy bear if anyone seems confused haha.
